## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I can see you found me. Yes, i know its not a mistake. 

I studied Information Technology at the University of Ghana, Legon. I had to exit the school in 2019 because that is when i graduated(of course). 
I know you're looking to do some more fun stuff with me through code and that is why I left this letter for you. Feel free to reach out to me. Or just find me through any of the contacts on the side.

#### What i can do
- Golang
- Google Cloud
- AWS
- Kubernetes setup and administration
- Linux
- Tinkering and more(just throw it at me)
